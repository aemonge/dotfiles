dotFiles
========

My dot files configs, but mainly my VIMRC !!!

## VIM
It uses [Vundle|https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim] as the main plug-in manager. It also needs you to manually compile
the [youCompleteMe|https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe] plugin and install `Ag` as a faster substitution of `Grep`.

## Zsh
Please check oh-my-zsh first

## Tmux
Please download all tmux themes before ;)
